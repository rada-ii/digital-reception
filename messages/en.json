    "questions": {
      "q1": {
        "question": "Why is a self check-in kiosk better than a mobile app?",
        "answer": "The kiosk eliminates all barriers for guests - no app installation, registration, or roaming complications. Foreign guests often don't have a local number or the habit of installing apps. With a kiosk, all the guest needs to do is come to reception and get their key in 30 seconds. Simple, fast, without any prior preparation needed from the guest."
      },
      "q2": {
        "question": "How much does it cost and how quickly does the investment pay off?",
        "answer": "Call us or schedule a demo meeting for exact prices that are formed according to your needs and service packages. The price includes: touchscreen kiosk, installation, PMS integration, staff training, first year of maintenance. Most hotels recover their investment in 8-12 months through reduced staff costs, increased efficiency, and higher guest satisfaction (better ratings = more bookings)."
      },
      "q3": {
        "question": "What does the check-in process look like for guests?",
        "answer": "The process is simple and takes 30-60 seconds:\n1) Guest scans QR code or enters reservation number\n2) System automatically loads data from PMS\n3) Guest confirms or updates data\n4) System automatically registers guest in eTourist\n5) Card payment (if needed)\n6) Printing receipt and issuing keycard\n7) System sends email with all stay details\n\nEverything happens on one screen, intuitively and quickly!"
      },
      "q4": {
        "question": "Does it integrate with PMS systems?",
        "answer": "Yes! Digital reception integrates with most popular PMS systems such as Opera, Cloudbeds, Mews, Protel, Fidelio, HotelTime, and others. Integration enables real-time synchronization of reservations, room availability, prices, and check-in status. If you use a less known PMS, contact us - we probably already support it or can add support."
      },
      "q5": {
        "question": "How long does digital reception installation take?",
        "answer": "Installation takes between 2-4 hours, depending on the complexity of integration with existing systems. The process includes: physical kiosk installation, PMS connection, payment configuration, testing, staff training. After installation, our team remains available for 24/7 support. The system is ready to use immediately after installation!"
      },
      "q6": {
        "question": "Can I test before purchasing?",
        "answer": "Absolutely! We offer a free demo presentation where you can see the system live and try all functions. The demo lasts 30 minutes and can be online (Google Meet/Zoom) or live at your hotel. We can also arrange a visit to a hotel already using our system so you can see it in practice. No obligation - our goal is for you to be 100% confident in your decision before purchasing."
      },
      "q7": {
        "question": "What kind of technical support is provided?",
        "answer": "We offer 24/7 technical support via phone, email, and remote desktop. Most problems are resolved within 15 minutes via remote access. The system automatically sends notifications about potential issues (e.g., printer out of paper), so we can resolve them before guests notice a problem. Regular software updates are installed automatically at night when there are no guests."
      },
      "q8": {
        "question": "What if a guest doesn't want to use the kiosk?",
        "answer": "The kiosk doesn't replace reception - it complements it! Guests who prefer human contact can still check in at reception. But statistics show that 85% of guests, after seeing how fast kiosk check-in is once, voluntarily use the kiosk next time. Younger generations (Gen Z, Millennials) expect self-service options, while older generations learn quickly when they see how simple it is."
